## 🔧 What I Do

**RHEL/Linux Systems Administration (43+ Production Servers):**
- Package management (yum/dnf), system updates, and patch coordination
- User and group management, permissions, sudo policy enforcement
- System monitoring, performance tuning, and troubleshooting
- Red Hat Satellite content view management and environment promotion
- Storage management, filesystem operations, LVM configuration
- Network configuration, firewall rules (firewalld), SELinux policies
- Service management (systemd), daemon configuration
- Boot process troubleshooting and /boot space management
- Log analysis and system auditing for compliance

**Infrastructure Automation (Ansible):**
- Implemented Ansible across enterprise (reduced configuration change times dramatically)
- Automated server bootstrapping and initial configuration
- SSH hardening and security policy enforcement at scale
- Automated pre-patch validation (storage checks, service health)
- User access auditing across entire server fleet
- Configuration drift prevention and remediation
- Deployed AWX (Ansible Tower) in production using K3s


**Home Lab Infrastructure:**
- Proxmox hypervisor managing multiple VMs and containers
- NGINX reverse proxy with automated SSL (Let's Encrypt + Cloudflare DNS)
- Grafana + Prometheus monitoring and alerting
- Unraid NAS with NFS shares for centralized storage
- Tailscale mesh VPN for secure remote access
- Built entire infrastructure from scratch on repurposed hardware

**Tech Stack:**
```
Operating Systems:  RHEL 7/8/9, CentOS, Ubuntu Server

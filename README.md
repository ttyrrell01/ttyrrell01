# 👋 Hi, I'm Tyler

**Linux Systems Administrator | Red Hat Enterprise Linux Specialist**

Self-taught RHEL administrator managing 43+ production servers. Expert in system administration, automation with Ansible, and infrastructure hardening. Went from restaurant work to enterprise Linux administration in 3 years.

## 🔧 What I Do

**RHEL/Linux Systems Administration (43+ Production Servers):**
- Package management (yum/dnf), system updates, and patch coordination
- User and group management, permissions, sudo policy enforcement
- System monitoring, performance tuning, and troubleshooting
- Red Hat Satellite content view management and environment promotion
- Storage management, filesystem operations, LVM configuration
- Network configuration, firewall rules (firewalld), SELinux policies
- Service management (systemd), daemon configuration
- Boot process troubleshooting and /boot space management
- Log analysis and system auditing for compliance

**Infrastructure Automation (Ansible):**
- Implemented Ansible across enterprise (reduced configuration change times dramatically)
- Automated server bootstrapping and initial configuration
- SSH hardening and security policy enforcement at scale
- Automated pre-patch validation (storage checks, service health)
- User access auditing across entire server fleet
- Configuration drift prevention and remediation
- Deployed AWX (Ansible Tower) in production using K3s

**Containerization & Orchestration:**
- Docker for production services (DNS, reverse proxy, monitoring stack)
- K3s Kubernetes for AWX deployment (home and work environments)
- Container networking, volume management, image optimization
- Multi-container application stacks

**Home Lab Infrastructure:**
- Proxmox hypervisor managing multiple VMs and containers
- NGINX reverse proxy with automated SSL (Let's Encrypt + Cloudflare DNS)
- Grafana + Prometheus monitoring and alerting
- Unraid NAS with NFS shares for centralized storage
- Tailscale mesh VPN for secure remote access
- Built entire infrastructure from scratch on repurposed hardware

**Tech Stack:**
```
Operating Systems:  RHEL 7/8/9, CentOS, Ubuntu Server
Config Management:  Ansible (playbooks, roles, AWX)
Containers:         Docker, K3s/Kubernetes
Monitoring:         Prometheus, Grafana, system logs
Networking:         Firewalld, SELinux, NFS, DNS, Tailscale
Web Services:       NGINX, SSL/TLS automation
Virtualization:     Proxmox VE, KVM
Version Control:    Git, GitLab
Scripting:          Bash (daily), Python (learning)
Red Hat Tools:      Satellite, subscription-manager, systemd
```

## 🚀 My Journey

**2021** - Restaurant worker, self-teaching Linux at night  
**2022** - Helpdesk technician  
**2023** - Promoted to Linux Administrator  
**2024** - Implementing Ansible automation at scale  
**2025** - Building toward DevOps engineering (RHCSA, AWS, K8s)

**Key Wins:**
- Zero tech background → managing 43 production RHEL servers in 3 years
- Implemented Ansible automation that improved operational efficiency
- Hardened entire server fleet: SSH, firewall, SELinux, sudo policies
- Built automated pre-flight checks preventing patching failures
- Deployed AWX in production using K3s (home and work)
- Built enterprise-grade home lab with Proxmox, monitoring, and automation
- Successfully managing Red Hat Satellite content lifecycle
